WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter Simulator) is an open-source wave energy converter (WEC) simulation tool. The code is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver SimMechanics. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom as described in the WEC-Sim Theory Manual. The WEC-Sim project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office and the code development effort is a collaboration between the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]((www.nrel.gov/water)) and [Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)](http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=834).

#Installing
Once the code is downloaded, unzip the source code folder and follow the installation guidelines presented in the WEC-Sim User Guide. The WEC-Sim development team has also developed a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgDbRY6Lvao) that demonstrates how to setup and run a simulation.

User Questionnaire**
We encourage all WEC-Sim users to complete the [WEC-Sim questionnaire](http://goo.gl/nFsWYu.info). Your feedback will be used to help direct future code development and improvement efforts.
